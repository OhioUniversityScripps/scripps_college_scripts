# Exclude Apps

This directory works in conjunction with [Scripps College's Hello IT Installs](https://github.com/OhioUniversityScripps/scripps_college_scripts/tree/master/edu.ohio.scrippscollege.HelloIT), specifically, the [softwareGrid.py](https://github.com/OhioUniversityScripps/scripps_college_scripts/blob/master/edu.ohio.scrippscollege.HelloIT/payload/Library/Management/HelloIT/softwareGrid.py) script.

Any applications that you **don't** want to show up in the GRID should be placed here. To keep things tidy, try to keep this list alphabetically sorted and free of duplicates.

The list should be mostly system apps, helper binaries, or other apps that are irrelevent to standard users.

Any changes to this file will be reflected on ALL clients immediately. See [the script](https://github.com/OhioUniversityScripps/scripps_college_scripts/blob/master/edu.ohio.scrippscollege.HelloIT/payload/Library/Management/HelloIT/softwareGrid.py#L16) for details.
