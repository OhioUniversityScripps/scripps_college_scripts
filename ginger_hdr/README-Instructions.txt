Hi, and thanks for downloading Ginger HDR!  You probably want to install it,
so here's how:

0.  If you have an older version, you want to hide your copy of GingerHDR-mac32.plugin 
and/or GingerHDR-mac64.plugin so that After Effects/Premiere can't find it.  Note that
you should copy it into a safe place (in case this new version has bugs).  Just make sure
it's out of the Applications directory tree and it should be fine.  If you don't remove it
then After Effects will give you a warning that you have conflicts.

1.  First, you have already agreed to the Ginger HDR License when you downloaded
the zip file.  Second, you should have unzipped the zip file to open this one.

2.  The versions of Ginger HDR included in this distribution only work with After Effects
version 3.0 and higher and Premiere verions 5.0 and higher, both for Mac OS.  If you are using
CS 3.0 or CS 4.0, then you will be using the 32-bit version (Ginger-HDR-Adobe-Mac32).  And if 
you are using CS 5.0 or CS 5.5, you will be using the 64-bit version (Ginger-HDR-Adobe-Mac64).


3.  Find the directory where After Effects\Premiere is installed.  For After Effects,
copy the correct Ginger-HDR-AE__ directory into the "Support Files\Plug-ins\Effects"
subdirectory.  For Premiere the subdirectory is "Plug-ins\Common".  In my case, the complete
paths are:

After Effects 5.5:
/Applications/Adobe After Effects CS5.5/Plug-ins/Effects/ 

After Effects 3.0:
/Applications/Adobe After Effects CS5.5/Plug-ins/Effects/ 

Premiere is a little trickier.
    - Go to Finder, and on the far left side under PLACES click Applications.
    - Click on the folder for Adobe Premiere Pro CS5.5
    - In that folder, there is an application called Adobe Premiere Pro CS5.5.  Right-click
        on it and select Show Package Contents.  This step will open a new Finder window.
    - In the new Finder window, click on Contents, then Plug-Ins, then Common.
    - That common directory is where you should put it.

Then copy the entire directory (Ginger-HDR-Adobe-Mac32 or Ginger-HDR-Adobe-Mac64) to that path.

4. Activate the license.  Run the file LicenseManager and when you press "Go" it will
phone home and create a license for you.

5. Now run After Effects (or Premiere), add the "Ginger HDR->Tonemap Basic" effect and you
should be off and running.

Thanks again!
