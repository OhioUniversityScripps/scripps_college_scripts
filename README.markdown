Because of the sensitive nature of some of these assets, we're unable to post everything needed to make these work.  We attempt to point out any missing files or a broader description of what is needed to make this work and/or why it's used.  Also, there is no guarantee that this stuff will work.  It works for us, but it might not work for you.  Good luck!
